# RORWebController

ESP32 Roll Off Roof Controller
This project aims to update the existing Arduino setup on a Roll Off Roof observatory with a new ESP32-based controller. The ESP32 will replace the current Arduino program and provide additional features, such as a web server and weather sensor.

The new controller will have the same functionality as the existing Arduino program, including controlling a Scope Mount Safe, Open and Close roof switch, Aleko AR950  gate opener, and ASCOM.

With the new web server, users will be able to log in to the website from their iPhone and remotely control the roof without the need for the Astro Computer to be on and running an ASCOM dome program.

This project is being developed using Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO.

Please note that this project is still in the early stages of development, and more details will be added as the project progresses.
